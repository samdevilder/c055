			<p class="questioneight">IE reacted totally different to the HTML and CSS files compared to Chrome and Firefox. IE ended up downloading the entire database when we submitted the form. Chrome and Firefox on the other hand had normal expected results when we submitted the form. Something that should also be taken note of is the different results that can arise from the use of padding adjustments versus margin adjustments. In our code we used padding for some of the headers and the navigation and paragraphs for the Screen.css stylesheet. We had originally worked on the stylesheet and HTML file on a 1080p monitor, but viewing it now on a Surface Pro 4, which has a resolution ratio of 3:2 (3000 x 2000p), the website doesn’t scale as well as the screen resolution increases (both viewings were done in the Chrome browser). The print style we had established in the Print stylesheet that the web site would always and should always be printed on an A4 sheet, this applies to all browsers and it ensures that the scaling doesn’t change.</p>

            <li><p> The Benefits of CSSOne of the key benefits to using CSS is that you can easily change a single thing or multiple aspects of your web site without having to change every other web page. Using CSS also allows for faster Web page download time. This is due to having less code behind your web pages. Regarding search engines, CSS is considered a clean coding technique, meaning search engines won't have to struggle with more content than code. CSS offers flexibility in regards to viewing options. It can have a flexible foundation, meaning that your web page can be viewed comfortably on a number of devices, instead of suffering an extremely awkward look on bigger or smaller screens.

            <li><p> We would have expected it to either unitalicize or bold the emphasized section so that it would stand out but instead you see no noticeable difference.
            </p></li>

            <li><p> We picked Chrome and Internet Explorer and we found that the main differences between Chrome and IE is that Chrome has a faster response time and download speed, uses more ram. and has a lot more extensions.

		<li><p class="shortanswer">The key multilingual issues that the W3C address within the internationalization activity can be summarized as any barriers of deployment and use of the Web and its technologies due to either language, script, region or culture. Within this Internationalization activity there are three major groups known as the International Working Group (IWG), the International Interest Group, and the Internationalization Tag Set (ITS) Interest Group, each group serving a different role within the activity.</p>
		<p class="shortanswer">It is the IWG that produces content and documents. These include requirements, guidelines and proposals for specification writers, as well as educational resources, anything to help developers and content creators to better understand and more widely implement the Internationalization aspects of W3C technology. Under their Activity Project RADAR page (http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/projects/) we will find that the projects fall under categories Requirements development, Developer guidelines, Reviews, discussion, advice, Implementation support, Education and outreach. All the projects run by the Internationalization activity aim to make the Web more universal. To break down all language, cultural and region barriers on the World Wide Web.

		<li><p class="shortanswer">http://www.few.vu.nl and http://cs.vu.nl both share the ip adress 130.37.164.154. We found this by using the following website: <a href="https://www.site24x7.com/find-ip-address-of-web-sit.html">www.site24x7.com</a>. Sharing the same IP address can reduce costs for most businesses and institutions with exceptions for corporate giants like Google (a company with multiple data centers). For most companies and educational institutes, to have multiple dedicated servers for each branch or course that they offer would be impractical and cost inefficient since the costs would outweigh the benefits they would gain from the multiple dedicated servers. Another issue regarding a server's functionality is security. Since both http://www.few.vu.nl and http://www.cs.vu.nl share an IP address, if there were to be a DDoS attack on either of these sites, all other sites sharing this IP address with them would also be out of service until the attack is resolved.

		<li><p class="shortanswer">Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a much more advanced protocol and has better features than IPv4. Designed to be an evolutionary upgrade that will allow steady growth over time both in terms of Internet traffic and number of hosts connected. It has an infinite number of addresses. It will replace IPv4 world to solve the growing number of networks and the shortage of IP addresses. The number of bits in an IPv4-address are 32 in format decimal equating to a possible 4.3 billion number of addresses. An IPv6-address contains 128 bits in a hexadecimal format which equates to an infinite possible number of addresses. IPv6 will also make some important technological changes that were issues under IPv4. Changes such as auto-configuration, no more private address collisions, better multicast routing and more. <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/ipv6_ipv4_difference.html">http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/ipv6_ipv4_difference.html</a>

				<li><p class="shortanswer">For this question we used our default browser, Google Chrome. We were able to enable the console by first checking that JavaScript has been enabled for all pages on the Web in our browser's settings. Then by right-clicking somewhere on the lab3 web page on BB and choosing the inspect option we were greeted with a form displaying all the HTML elements of the page.</p>
					<p class="shortanswer"> We then clicked on the tab "Console" and found the two (2) hidden <code> console.log() </code> messages "Hello World!" and "We advise you to always ...".

				<li><p class="shortanswer"><abbr title="Asynchronous Javascript and XML">'AJAX'</abbr> - asynchronous JavaScript and XML. <em>Asynchronous</em> refers to a non-sequential I/O (input/output), a form of processing that allows other non-I/O-dependant processing to continue before transmission has finished. The simple approach to I/O would be synchronous I/O. While it is simple, it does leave a lot of system resources remaining idle while they wait for all processing to be completed. However in an asynchronous approach, any task that relies on the I/O being complete will still have to wait, but other processing that has no dependency on the I/O operation can continue.</p></li>
				<li><p class="shortanswer">Host objects are provided by the enviroment and can differ dependent on the browser you use. Common host objects are document and form.

		<p>Question 1<p>
		<ol class="labquestions" type="a">
			<li><p class="shortanswer">We believe that the tokenizer had done its job well yet there is still room for improvement. After sorting the table by the chapter V1, RStudio then shows us the words and the frequency of the words in the first chapter, we saw that the letter ‘s’ appears frequently throughout the whole of the novel. The only explanation for this standalone-letter to appear so frequently is that after the tokenization and deleting of punctuation, it counts the ‘s’ after an apostrophe as a word on its own. This could be fixed by either having the tokenization process simply ignore what comes after apostrophes, or to have it not delete apostrophes and include those words in the dictionary</p></li>
			<li><p class="shortanswer">Looking at the top 30 words, most of them should be included, as most of the words were expected to be in the top 30 i.e. “the”, “and”, “to”, and “a”. However, referring back to the previous question, there are stand-alone letters like “s” and “t” that find themselves in the top 30 that shouldn’t really be included. This is because they aren’t technically words on their own, rather the suffix of a variety, meaning that these apostrophes and “s’s” and “t’s” aren’t all coming from one sort of word, hence they shouldn’t be included in the top 30 most frequently used words this list.</p></li>
			<li><p class="shortanswer">Looking at the frequency matrix, we noted that the first 30 words do not follow Zipf’s law. The increments at which they decrease after the most and second-most frequent words are too small. Zipf’s law indicates that words should appear at half the frequency as the word prior to it. Instead, the difference between the most frequent word and the second-most are half however the third most frequent shows up only 100 times less frequent, which does not equate to half of frequency of the second most frequent word.
			<img src="https://s27.postimg.org/5emo1izyr/assignment4_1.png" style="width:50%";>
			</p></li>
			<li><p class="shortanswer">After looking at the graph that RStudio has produced of Heap’s Law in reference to our top 30 most frequent words list on the Alice text file, we can see that it follows Heap’s Law almost exactly. The unique vocabulary as the machine searches through the text increases drastically.

		</ol>
		<p> Question 2</p>

		<ol class="labquestions" type="a">
			<li><p class="shortanswer">We assess the quality of a TF-based search by assessing both its precision and the recall of the search. When it comes to precision, the number of relevant information in the data that is provided by the program. Precision of the TF-based search was dependent on the frequency of the query throughout the Alice.txt file. The more frequent a query, the more relevant information would be given back by RStudio. Recall of the TF-based search is also dependent on the frequency of the query yet if we wanted more information than just which chapters our query is found in and their frequency, perhaps we would also like to know which lines they appear on. In that case the recall of the search is lacking in some areas. Always room for improvement.</p></li>
			<li><p class="shortanswer">The difference between the TF-based search and TFIDF-based search is that the TFIDF score reflects the importance of the document in the collection, in this case, on a per chapter basis. The TFIDF score increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, but also considers the frequency of the word in the corpus. The three terms with the highest TFIDF scores are:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Footman – 6.946012</li>
				<li>Dance - 6.769048</li>
				<li>Pigeon – 6.578965</li>
			</ol>
			I believe that these terms reflect their respective chapters well.

			<li><p class="shortanswer">	It doesn’t make sense to set the variable k to 5 when trying to because after discarding the initial chapter (title page) there are only 11 chapters left to choose from. If we were to take the top 5 chapters that would already be half the text that we would have to analyze. To implement a number like 5 to the variable k, would be better for a file that would span across thousands of chapters, in which case looking across the 5 highest ranked results would be preferred.</p></li>
			<li><p class="shortanswer">The precision would increase while the recall might also increase.</p></li>
