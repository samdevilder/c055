			<p class="questioneight">IE reacted totally different to the HTML and CSS files compared to Chrome and Firefox. IE ended up downloading the entire database when we submitted the form. Chrome and Firefox on the other hand had normal expected results when we submitted the form. Something that should also be taken note of is the different results that can arise from the use of padding adjustments versus margin adjustments. In our code we used padding for some of the headers and the navigation and paragraphs for the Screen.css stylesheet. We had originally worked on the stylesheet and HTML file on a 1080p monitor, but viewing it now on a Surface Pro 4, which has a resolution ratio of 3:2 (3000 x 2000p), the website doesn’t scale as well as the screen resolution increases (both viewings were done in the Chrome browser). The print style we had established in the Print stylesheet that the web site would always and should always be printed on an A4 sheet, this applies to all browsers and it ensures that the scaling doesn’t change.</p>

            <li><p> The Benefits of CSSOne of the key benefits to using CSS is that you can easily change a single thing or multiple aspects of your web site without having to change every other web page. Using CSS also allows for faster Web page download time. This is due to having less code behind your web pages. Regarding search engines, CSS is considered a clean coding technique, meaning search engines won't have to struggle with more content than code. CSS offers flexibility in regards to viewing options. It can have a flexible foundation, meaning that your web page can be viewed comfortably on a number of devices, instead of suffering an extremely awkward look on bigger or smaller screens.

            <li><p> We would have expected it to either unitalicize or bold the emphasized section so that it would stand out but instead you see no noticeable difference.
            </p></li>

            <li><p> We picked Chrome and Internet Explorer and we found that the main differences between Chrome and IE is that Chrome has a faster response time and download speed, uses more ram. and has a lot more extensions.

		<li><p class="shortanswer">The key multilingual issues that the W3C address within the internationalization activity can be summarized as any barriers of deployment and use of the Web and its technologies due to either language, script, region or culture. Within this Internationalization activity there are three major groups known as the International Working Group (IWG), the International Interest Group, and the Internationalization Tag Set (ITS) Interest Group, each group serving a different role within the activity.</p>
		<p class="shortanswer">It is the IWG that produces content and documents. These include requirements, guidelines and proposals for specification writers, as well as educational resources, anything to help developers and content creators to better understand and more widely implement the Internationalization aspects of W3C technology. Under their Activity Project RADAR page (http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/projects/) we will find that the projects fall under categories Requirements development, Developer guidelines, Reviews, discussion, advice, Implementation support, Education and outreach. All the projects run by the Internationalization activity aim to make the Web more universal. To break down all language, cultural and region barriers on the World Wide Web.

		<li><p class="shortanswer">http://www.few.vu.nl and http://cs.vu.nl both share the ip adress 130.37.164.154. We found this by using the following website: <a href="https://www.site24x7.com/find-ip-address-of-web-sit.html">www.site24x7.com</a>. Sharing the same IP address can reduce costs for most businesses and institutions with exceptions for corporate giants like Google (a company with multiple data centers). For most companies and educational institutes, to have multiple dedicated servers for each branch or course that they offer would be impractical and cost inefficient since the costs would outweigh the benefits they would gain from the multiple dedicated servers. Another issue regarding a server's functionality is security. Since both http://www.few.vu.nl and http://www.cs.vu.nl share an IP address, if there were to be a DDoS attack on either of these sites, all other sites sharing this IP address with them would also be out of service until the attack is resolved.

		<li><p class="shortanswer">Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a much more advanced protocol and has better features than IPv4. Designed to be an evolutionary upgrade that will allow steady growth over time both in terms of Internet traffic and number of hosts connected. It has an infinite number of addresses. It will replace IPv4 world to solve the growing number of networks and the shortage of IP addresses. The number of bits in an IPv4-address are 32 in format decimal equating to a possible 4.3 billion number of addresses. An IPv6-address contains 128 bits in a hexadecimal format which equates to an infinite possible number of addresses. IPv6 will also make some important technological changes that were issues under IPv4. Changes such as auto-configuration, no more private address collisions, better multicast routing and more. <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/ipv6_ipv4_difference.html">http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/ipv6_ipv4_difference.html</a>

				<li><p class="shortanswer"><abbr title="Asynchronous Javascript and XML">'AJAX'</abbr> - asynchronous JavaScript and XML. <em>Asynchronous</em> refers to a non-sequential I/O (input/output), a form of processing that allows other non-I/O-dependant processing to continue before transmission has finished. The simple approach to I/O would be synchronous I/O. While it is simple, it does leave a lot of system resources remaining idle while they wait for all processing to be completed. However in an asynchronous approach, any task that relies on the I/O being complete will still have to wait, but other processing that has no dependency on the I/O operation can continue.</p></li>
				<li><p class="shortanswer">Host objects are provided by the enviroment and can differ dependent on the browser you use. Common host objects are document and form.

		<p>Question 1<p>
		<ol class="labquestions" type="a">
			<li><p class="shortanswer">We believe that the tokenizer had done its job well yet there is still room for improvement. After sorting the table by the chapter V1, RStudio then shows us the words and the frequency of the words in the first chapter, we saw that the letter ‘s’ appears frequently throughout the whole of the novel. The only explanation for this standalone-letter to appear so frequently is that after the tokenization and deleting of punctuation, it counts the ‘s’ after an apostrophe as a word on its own. This could be fixed by either having the tokenization process simply ignore what comes after apostrophes, or to have it not delete apostrophes and include those words in the dictionary</p></li>
			<li><p class="shortanswer">Looking at the top 30 words, most of them should be included, as most of the words were expected to be in the top 30 i.e. “the”, “and”, “to”, and “a”. However, referring back to the previous question, there are stand-alone letters like “s” and “t” that find themselves in the top 30 that shouldn’t really be included. This is because they aren’t technically words on their own, rather the suffix of a variety, meaning that these apostrophes and “s’s” and “t’s” aren’t all coming from one sort of word, hence they shouldn’t be included in the top 30 most frequently used words this list.</p></li>
			<li><p class="shortanswer">Looking at the frequency matrix, we noted that the first 30 words do not follow Zipf’s law. The increments at which they decrease after the most and second-most frequent words are too small. Zipf’s law indicates that words should appear at half the frequency as the word prior to it. Instead, the difference between the most frequent word and the second-most are half however the third most frequent shows up only 100 times less frequent, which does not equate to half of frequency of the second most frequent word.
			<img src="https://s27.postimg.org/5emo1izyr/assignment4_1.png" style="width:50%";>
			</p></li>
			<li><p class="shortanswer">After looking at the graph that RStudio has produced of Heap’s Law in reference to our top 30 most frequent words list on the Alice text file, we can see that it follows Heap’s Law almost exactly. The unique vocabulary as the machine searches through the text increases drastically.

		<p> Question 2</p>

		<ol class="labquestions" type="a">
			<li><p class="shortanswer">We assess the quality of a TF-based search by assessing both its precision and the recall of the search. When it comes to precision, the number of relevant information in the data that is provided by the program. Precision of the TF-based search was dependent on the frequency of the query throughout the Alice.txt file. The more frequent a query, the more relevant information would be given back by RStudio. Recall of the TF-based search is also dependent on the frequency of the query yet if we wanted more information than just which chapters our query is found in and their frequency, perhaps we would also like to know which lines they appear on. In that case the recall of the search is lacking in some areas. Always room for improvement.</p></li>
			<li><p class="shortanswer">The difference between the TF-based search and TFIDF-based search is that the TFIDF score reflects the importance of the document in the collection, in this case, on a per chapter basis. The TFIDF score increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, but also considers the frequency of the word in the corpus. The three terms with the highest TFIDF scores are:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Footman – 6.946012</li>
				<li>Dance - 6.769048</li>
				<li>Pigeon – 6.578965</li>
			</ol>
			I believe that these terms reflect their respective chapters well.
			</p></li>
			<li><p class="shortanswer">	It doesn’t make sense to set the variable k to 5 when trying to because after discarding the initial chapter (title page) there are only 11 chapters left to choose from. If we were to take the top 5 chapters that would already be half the text that we would have to analyze. To implement a number like 5 to the variable k, would be better for a file that would span across thousands of chapters, in which case looking across the 5 highest ranked results would be preferred.</p></li>
			<li><p class="shortanswer">The precision would increase while the recall might also increase.</p></li>

			<li> <!-- Question 1 -->
				<ol>
					<li> <!-- Question 1.1 -->
						Idempotent in this case means that the method no matter how many times it is called by the client, the result from the server will not change. This only applies to the result or resource's representation, as a idempotent could still possibly change the resource.
					</li>
					<li> <!-- Question 1.2 -->
						Idempotent requests simplify the implementation of a caching HTTP proxy because idempotent methods are always stored on any middleware proxies that are between the client and the server.
					</li>
					<li> <!-- Question 1.3 -->
						Visitor counters often break this assumption because every time that a safe method like the GET method is called for the visitor counter, the client side isn't concerned with the side effects that it will have on the resource. The server however has to decide if the GET method should be an indicator to increment the visitor counter while responding to the GET request or if it should simply respond to the request without having to change anything about the resource.
					</li>
					<li> <!-- Question 1.4 -->
						Such counters could be negatively affected by the implementation of proxies because idempotent methods could possibly change the resource of the counter, but because it's an idempotent method, the change in the resource will only be saved in the middleware proxies between the user and server. Now the resource on the cache is different than that on the server. This would prove inconvenient for the counter on the main server as it will now have changes to the resource on all these different proxy caches due to the behavior of idempotent methods with resource changes.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li> <!-- Question 2 -->
				A stateless protocol is a communications protocol that treats each request as an independent transaction that is unrelated to any previous request so that the communication consists of independent pairs of request and response.
				<dl>
					<dt>Pro</dt>
					<dd>
						Simplifies server design because there is no need to dynamically allocate storage to deal with conversations in progress. If a client session dies in mid-transaction, no part of the system needs to be responsible for cleaning up the present state of the server.
					</dd>
					<dt>Con</dt>
					<dd>
						It may be necessary to include additional information in every request and this extra information will need to be interpreted by the server.
					</dd>
				</dl>
			</li>
			<li> <!-- Question 3 -->
				Web sites and online stores that utilize the 'shopping basket' functionality would be extremely hard to build without cookies because then we would need the server to record the entirety of the session with each client including their preferences and any relevant information, a purpose that could be easily solved with the implementation of cookies. Cookies are used to implement these e-shopping baskets by simply recording the basic information of the client along with anything that they've selected on the site. These cookies are stored on the users pc and whenever the client reconnects with the server, the server simply looks for any relevant cookies on the pc.
			</li>
			<li> <!-- Question 4 -->
				<p>
					The 303 status code in a response to a request means that the response to the request can be found under a different URI and SHOULD be retrieved using a GET method on that resource. This method exists primarily to allow the output of a POST-activated script to redirect the user agent to a selected resource. The 303 response MUST NOT be cached, but the response to the second (redirected) request might be cacheable.
				</p>
				<p>
					The different URI should be given by the 'Location' field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response should contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).
				</p>
				<p>
					The authoritative source that we used was <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">RFC 2616 section 10</a>, which contains the official notes on status code 303. The reason that this is an authoritative source is that it's the official documentation of status code 303.

				Allowed HTTP request methods: <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>OPTIONS</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>.<br>
				The origin that we are allowed to access from is '<code>*</code>' which is a wildcard origin
			</li>
			<li> <!-- Question 7 -->
				<p>I believe that the reason that the HEAD HTTP request doesn't also receive a response header for <code>Content-Type</code> because there is no content in the response body, so by default, there is no <code>Content-Type</code> header because there is no content to describe. I suspect that the content-type of the response body will be JSON. </p>
				<p>After making a <code>GET</code> request to the URL we found that the response body was received in JSON format. The reason for this is because JSON is a very lightweight format used for data exchanges. It's preferred over XML due to how much lighter it is in comparison.</p>

				We are able to see that our code did indeed update with our changes made to the file after successfully reloading from the obvious change in result that happened as well as the block of code that appears on the command line after reloading with words like "open connection" that indicate to us that the main process is still listening for any changes that will be made to the code.

			<li> <!-- Question 5 -->
				<p>I would apply A/B Testing to FaceBook, version A would make the homepage revolve more around the user's friends' posts and photos and less on the chat client. Version A would dedicate most of its screen area to displaying the shared photos of the user's friends and their latest posts. Perhaps develop an algorithm that would look at the frequency of the user's likes on various posts and pictures and then change the layout of the homepage to bring those friends that the user frequents the most to the top (making them a priority). I would measure the performance of this version by keeping track of how many stories and photos are being liked by users and timing how long users stay on the homepage.</p>
				<p>In version B, the site would be more chat client oriented, a complimentary design to that of A. Instead of the post and stories of friend's taking up the center of the page and roughly 50% of the page while the chat client only covers roughly 20% of the homepage, we could split it 40%/40%/20% (20% would be for the ads, searchbar and other misc. tools. I would measure the performance of this version by checking how long the user stays on site, how often they go offline from chat, and how much scrolling they do through the stories (to see if it increases/decreases/remains the same).</p>
				<p>My hypothesis for this problem would be that we would find an increase in the amount of time spent on Version A compared to the original version and B. This is because the homepage, where all the posts of friends and photos are found, is the main source of procastination on FaceBook. To be scrolling through the news feed of the hundreds of friends that each user might have would take on a lot of time. People might just keep on scrollling, totally unaware of the time that is passing by, the FaceBook stories wall does have that effect on people. I would hypothesize that Version B would see an increase in the amount of chats that would be taking place but also a decrease in the amount of time spent scrolling through the stories of the user's friends. This will most likely be due to the decrease in size of the news feed.</p>

				The <em>Common Log Format</em> helps develop Web log analysis software by recording all of the "who did what" to a page's structure. The Common Log Format can help analysts identify any security breaches and other computer misuse. Can be used for auditing and accounting purposes. All the information that comes from this format are used to record faults and help with diagnosis.
				<dl>
					<dt>Independent variable</dt><dd>The web site</dd>
					<dt>Dependent variable</dt><dd>Web site's link structure</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>My <em>hypothesis</em> would have been that the Common Log Format does indeed help developers and analysts in bettering their web sites in the sense that they now have more control over their content and any kind of contribution made by fellow collaborators. I'm sure that there is no bigger headache for a web developer than to have a contributer save in work that is either wrong or a security risk.</p>

				<p>Google had some humble beginnings, the first day on the Web, nothing on the page but a welcoming page header and two links stacked underneath. The two links, one of which would lead to a search page, provide the only color on screen, the classic, multicolored Google logo nowhere to be found. The next earliest snapshot of Google came a month later and already we start to see a little resemblance of the modern day site. The famous logo making its debut. Fast-forward a few years to 2001, we now see an Advanced Search (emphasis) and Preferences (emphasis) being added to the page. Ads and jobs with Google are a link away. </p>
				<p>2005, separate tabs for image searches, news, and groups based search. Froogle (pronounced frugal), a shopping based Google search, was also added onto the homepage. On the Froogle page, displays a table underneath showing the most frequently searched terms, all the terms were hyperlinks themselves. I checked the DOM of the snapshot of the site and the table isn’t dynamically filled. After this point, the site had begun to look like the Google homepage we know today. On special holidays and special occasions, Google would change the logo to be something either interactive or an image that would be incorporated into the logo.</p>
